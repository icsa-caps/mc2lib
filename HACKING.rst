Guidelines
==========

Following `C++ Core Guidelines <https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines>`_
where possible.

Naming and formatting is according to the `Google C++ Style Guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_. Use ``make format``.

New standards-compliant language features in C++11 are encouraged if they make
the code safer, more maintainable and/or easier to understand/use. The only
limiting factor is the oldest to be supported compiler versions (currently GCC
4.7, Clang 3.3).
