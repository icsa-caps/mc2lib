Guidelines
==========

Mostly following `Google C++ Style Guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_; with exceptions:

* New standards-compliant language features in C++11 are encouraged if they
  make the code safer, more maintainable and/or easier to understand/use. The
  only limiting factor is the oldest to be supported compiler version
  (currently GCC 4.7, Clang 3.3).

* "Exceptions" are fine, if it does not hurt performance.

And probably some other, obvious rules have not strictly been followed, for
reasons justified (in documentation) or obvious from design goals.
